# Welocme

This is a small proof-of-concept project which consists of two apps:

- Authentication service (AS) - it issues and verifies access tokens for clients.
- Resource service (RS) - it exposes a small protected REST API for reading/writing of resources.

The authentication schema follows the OAuth 2.0 protocol with password grant.

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/luchob/oauth2-passwordgrant-example/wiki).
Feel welcomed to report [issues](https://github.com/luchob/oauth2-passwordgrant-example/issues) or [contribute](https://github.com/luchob/oauth2-passwordgrant-example/pulls).

Have fun!
