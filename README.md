# Welocme

This is a small proof-of-concept project which consists of two apps:

- Authentication service (AS) - it issues and verifies access tokens for clients.
- Resource service - it exposes small protected REST API for reading and writing of resources.

The authentication schema follows the OAuth 2.0 protocol with password grant.
